## App Overview
SMS Filter Pro is a local SMS filtering utility that lets you block spam, organise messages, and create advanced rules using regular expressions.

## How to Enable SMS Filtering
Go to **Settings > Messages > Unknown & Spam** and enable the SMS Filter extension.

## Privacy
All filtering occurs locally on your device â€” your messages are never uploaded.

## Where can I learn more about regular expressions?
Using regular expressions (regex) allows you to create powerful, precise filtering rules. Here are some resources:
